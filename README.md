# Python-Project
Project : Snake Water Gun Game A fun and interactive game where the player competes against the computer in a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

Introduction

This Python code implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game involves three choices: Snake (Rock), Water (Paper), and Gun (Scissors). The user inputs their choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The code then determines the winner based on the game rules.

Key Concepts

1. Random Selection: The computer randomly selects its choice among Snake, Water, and Gun.
2. User Input: The user inputs their choice as 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, or 'g' for Gun.
3. Dictionary Mapping: Dictionaries are used to map user input to numerical values and vice versa.
4. Conditional Statements: The code uses conditional statements to determine the winner based on the game rules.
   
Code Structure

1. Import the random module for generating random choices.
2. Define the choices using comments: 1 for Snake, -1 for Water, and 0 for Gun.
3. Randomly select the computer's choice.
4. Prompt the user to input their choice.
5. Map user input to numerical values using dictionaries.
7. Print the choices made by the user and the computer.
8. Determine the winner based on the game rules using conditional statements.
